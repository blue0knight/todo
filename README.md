Wyncode : Let's Scaffold!


Here’s the deal: You just received an urgent email from the project manager at a company you work for. You need to create a Rails app by tomorrow!

Well that sucks.

At this point, hypothetically, you’re probably running to a senior dev to ask from some help creating a new webapp in one day. Let’s pretend that’s me (Ed).

So… how hard can it be to create a website in Rails? If someone asked you to create a complete To­do­ List web application, including HTML, CSS, Ruby, and a database, how much time would you quote them?

A week? Two weeks?

We’ve got two hours. Let’s go.

Start a new Rails app.

The point of this exercise is to demonstrate that, if you think about your models (building blocks, in our case we only needed a todo item) Rails can automatically generate a sample website for you. Then, all you have to do is make some adjustments to get a demo working.

Explore this app. Change the text displayed in your views, add some css, and take a close look at the different files we’ve defined here. Create a repo for this app, get it on GitHub, and send us the link!
